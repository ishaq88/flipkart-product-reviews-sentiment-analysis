## This app analyzes the reviews from the flipkart product pages and gives sentiment score.

Tech-Stack : Python, Torch, Huggingface-Transformers , flask

the model is saved locally inside a "model" directory which is needed for sentiment inference Check out <a href="https://huggingface.co/cardiffnlp/twitter-roberta-base-sentiment-latest"> Here </a> to know more about taking inference from pretrained model

*Note: The Flipkart reviews analyser only works on local host as when we try to fetch reviews from flipkart it gives internal server error but works perfectly fine for local host*
